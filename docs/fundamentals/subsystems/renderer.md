# Renderer

Location: `//impeller/renderer`

The very lowest level of the renderer that is still
backend agnostic. Allows users to build a renderer from scratch with few
restrictions. Has utilities for creating allocators, generating pipeline state
objects from bindings generated by `//impeller/compiler`, setting up render
passes, managing jumbo uniform-buffers, tessellators, etc..


## Renderer Backend

Location: `//impeller/renderer/backend`

Contains all the implementation details for a specific client rendering API. The
interfaces in these targets are meant to be private for non-WSI user targets. No
Impeller sub-frameworks may depend on these targets.
