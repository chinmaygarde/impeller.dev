# Tools

Location: `//impeller/tools`

Contains all GN rules and python scripts for working with Impeller. These
include GN rules processing GLSL shaders, including reflected shader information
as source set targets, and, including compiled shader intermediate
representations into the final executable as binary blobs for easier packaging.
